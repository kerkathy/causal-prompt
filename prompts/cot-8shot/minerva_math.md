Problem:
Find the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}
Solution:
The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative.
Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$.
Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$.
Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$
Solution:
We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}.$
Final Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
Solution:
If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \\begin{align*}
30n&=480\\\\
\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}
\\end{align*}
Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
If the system of equations

\\begin{align*}
6x-4y&=a,\\\\
6y-9x &=b.
\\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.
Solution:
If we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain

$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have

$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$
Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
What is the largest digit $N$ for which $2345N$ is divisible by 6?
Solution:
For a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. First, for divisibility by 2, the number must end in an even digit. The largest even digit is 8. Second, for divisibility by 3, the sum of all digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is $2+3+4+5+N=14+N$. For $14+N$ to be divisible by 3, we need $14+N \equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Since $14 \equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, we need $N \equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The possible values for $N$ are 1, 4, and 7. Since we also need $N$ to be even, the only even option among these is 4. Therefore, the largest digit $N$ is $\boxed{4}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $4$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
What is the intersection of the lines given by $2y=-x+3$ and $-y=5x+1$? Enter the answer as an ordered pair.
Solution:
First, let's rewrite the second equation in standard form: $-y=5x+1$ becomes $y=-5x-1$. Now we have the system:
- $2y = -x + 3$
- $y = -5x - 1$
Substituting the second equation into the first:
$2(-5x-1) = -x + 3$
$-10x - 2 = -x + 3$
$-10x + x = 3 + 2$
$-9x = 5$
$x = -\\frac{5}{9}$
Now substituting back to find $y$: $y = -5\left(-\\frac{5}{9}\right) - 1 = \\frac{25}{9} - 1 = \\frac{25}{9} - \\frac{9}{9} = \\frac{16}{9}$ Therefore, the intersection point is $\left(-\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9}\right)$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\left(-\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9}\right)$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
Find the value of $x$ that satisfies $\\frac{\\sqrt{3x+5}}{\\sqrt{6x+5}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}$. Express your answer as a common fraction.
Solution:
Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:
$\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3x+5}}{\\sqrt{6x+5}}\right)^2=\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2$
This simplifies to: $\\frac{3x+5}{6x+5}=\\frac{5}{9}$
Cross-multiply:
$9(3x+5)=5(6x+5)$
$27x+45=30x+25$
$45-25=30x-27x$
$20=3x$
$x=\\frac{20}{3}$
Final Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{20}{3}$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
The fifth and eighth terms of a geometric sequence of real numbers are $7!$ and $8!$ respectively. What is the first term?
Solution:
In a geometric sequence, the $n$th term is given by $ar^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.
Given information:
- $a_5 = ar^4 = 7! = 5040$
- $a_8 = ar^7 = 8! = 40320$
To find the common ratio, divide the second equation by the first:
$\\frac{ar^7}{ar^4} = \\frac{8!}{7!}$
$r^3 = \\frac{8!}{7!} = 8$
$r = 2$
Now substitute $r = 2$ into the first equation:
$a \\cdot 2^4 = 7!$
$a \\cdot 16 = 5040$
$a = \\frac{5040}{16} = 315$
Final Answer: The final answer is $315$. I hope it is correct.
