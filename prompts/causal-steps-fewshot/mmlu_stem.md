Problem: Find the domain of the expression $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$.
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) [-5,-2), (B) [2,5), (C) [-2,-5), (D) [5,2)

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: x (independent), numerator $\sqrt{x-2}$ (dependent), denominator $\sqrt{5-x}$ (dependent)
- Causal relationships: x value → expression under square roots → domain validity
- System boundaries: Real number domain, square root and division operations
- Feasibility: Expression must be defined (no negative square roots, no division by zero)

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- Square root in numerator: x-2 ≥ 0 causally required for real output
- Square root in denominator: 5-x > 0 causally required (positive, not just non-negative)
- Critical dependency: Both conditions must hold simultaneously
- Counterfactual: If x < 2, numerator becomes undefined; if x ≥ 5, denominator becomes undefined/zero

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention 1: Solve x-2 ≥ 0 to find numerator constraint
- Intervention 2: Solve 5-x > 0 to find denominator constraint  
- Intervention 3: Find intersection of both constraints
- Prediction: Domain will be interval satisfying both conditions

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute intervention 1: x-2 ≥ 0 → x ≥ 2
- Execute intervention 2: 5-x > 0 → x < 5
- Execute intervention 3: x ≥ 2 AND x < 5 → x ∈ [2,5)
- Verification: At x=2, numerator=0 (valid); at x=5, denominator=0 (invalid)
- Causal path: x value → sqrt constraints → domain [2,5)

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: [2,5) satisfies both x ≥ 2 and x < 5 ✓
- Counterfactual consistency: x=1.9 makes numerator undefined ✓, x=5.1 makes denominator undefined ✓
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied

Final Answer: The final answer is $(B)$. I hope it is correct.

Problem: If $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\det \mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}).$
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) 14, (B) 4, (C) 2, (D) 24

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: det A (2, observed), det B (12, observed), det(AB) (unknown, dependent)
- Causal relationships: Individual determinants → product determinant via multiplication rule
- System boundaries: Matrix multiplication and determinant operations
- Feasibility: Determinant multiplication rule must apply

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- Fundamental theorem: det(AB) = det(A) × det(B) causally determines result
- Critical dependency: Product determinant depends multiplicatively on individual determinants
- Counterfactual: If det A = 1, then det(AB) = 12; if det B = 1, then det(AB) = 2

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention: Apply determinant multiplication rule directly
- Operation: Multiply det(A) by det(B)
- Prediction: This will yield det(AB) through causal rule

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute: det(AB) = det(A) × det(B) = 2 × 12 = 24
- Verification: Multiplication rule applied correctly ✓
- Causal path: Individual determinants (2, 12) → Multiplication rule → Product determinant (24)

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: Result follows from fundamental theorem ✓
- Counterfactual consistency: Different individual determinants would yield proportionally different results ✓
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied

Final Answer: The final answer is $(D)$. I hope it is correct.

Problem: Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) 12, (B) 20, (C) 16, (D) 15

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: Weight per rep (20→15 lbs per weight), number of reps (12→unknown), total weight (constant)
- Causal relationships: (weight per rep) × (number of reps) → total weight
- System boundaries: Single workout session, weight conservation principle
- Feasibility: New rep count must be positive integer

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- Total weight causally determined by: 2 × weight × reps
- Critical dependency: Maintaining constant total requires inverse relationship between weight and reps
- Counterfactual: If weight decreases, reps must increase proportionally to maintain total

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention 1: Calculate original total weight
- Intervention 2: Set up equation with new weight and unknown reps
- Intervention 3: Solve for new rep count to maintain total
- Prediction: Lighter weights require more reps to maintain same total

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute intervention 1: Original total = 2 × 20 × 12 = 480 pounds
- Execute intervention 2: New total = 2 × 15 × n = 30n pounds
- Execute intervention 3: 30n = 480 → n = 16
- Verification: 2 × 15 × 16 = 480 ✓
- Causal path: Weight reduction → Compensatory rep increase → Maintained total

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: n = 16 > 0 ✓ (feasible rep count)
- Counterfactual consistency: If weight were 10 lbs, reps would need to be 24 ✓
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $(C)$. I hope it is correct.

Problem: If the system of equations
\begin{align*}
6x - 4y &= a,\\
6y - 9x &= b
\end{align*}
has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) $-\frac{2}{3}$, (B) $\frac{2}{3}$, (C) $\frac{1}{3}$, (D) $\frac{4}{9}$

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: x, y (nonzero solution variables), a, b (dependent parameters)
- Causal relationships: Solution existence → constraint on a/b ratio
- System boundaries: Linear system with nonzero solution requirement
- Feasibility: System must have nontrivial solution, b ≠ 0

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- For nonzero solution to exist, equations must be linearly dependent
- Critical dependency: Coefficients must maintain proportional relationship
- Counterfactual: If equations were independent, only trivial solution would exist

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention 1: Manipulate first equation to match second equation's form
- Intervention 2: Use linear dependence to relate a and b
- Intervention 3: Solve for a/b ratio
- Prediction: Linear dependence will reveal fixed ratio

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute intervention 1: Multiply first equation by -3/2: -3/2(6x - 4y) = -9x + 6y = -3a/2
- Execute intervention 2: This equals the left side of second equation: -9x + 6y = b
- Execute intervention 3: Therefore -3a/2 = b → a/b = -2/3
- Verification: Linear dependence maintained ✓
- Causal path: Nonzero solution requirement → Linear dependence → Fixed ratio a/b = -2/3

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: a/b = -2/3 ensures linear dependence ✓
- Counterfactual consistency: Different ratio would prevent nontrivial solution ✓
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $(A)$. I hope it is correct.
