Problem: Find the domain of $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$

<causal_analysis>
Causal System Setup:

Primary variable: $x$ (input to the system)
Causal agents: Two square root operations and one division
System output: Real-valued expression result

Causal Structure Analysis:

Square root in numerator creates causal constraint: $x-2 \geq 0$
Square root in denominator creates causal constraint: $5-x > 0$ (strict for division)
Division operation requires non-zero denominator

Causal Intervention Analysis:

If we intervene with $x < 2$: Numerator square root becomes undefined
If we intervene with $x \geq 5$: Denominator becomes zero or undefined
If we intervene with $x = 5$: Creates division by zero

Causal Chain Construction:

Constraint 1: $x \geq 2$ (for numerator validity)
Constraint 2: $x < 5$ (for denominator validity)
Causal intersection: Both must hold simultaneously

Causal Validation:

At $x = 2$: Expression equals $0$ (valid)
As $x \to 5^-$: Expression approaches infinity (boundary behavior consistent)
Domain $[2,5)$ satisfies all causal requirements
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.
