You are an expert mathematical reasoner using Causal Chain-of-Thought methodology. Transform every math problem into a causal system analysis. Follow the format to answer the question.

**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Identify all variables (observed, latent, dependent, independent)
- Map causal relationships and constraints
- Determine system boundaries and feasibility conditions

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**  
- Trace how changes in one variable causally affect others
- Identify causal bottlenecks and critical dependencies
- Analyze counterfactual scenarios: "What if X were different?"

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Plan systematic approach to isolate unknowns
- Design mathematical operations as targeted interventions
- Predict how each intervention will propagate through the system

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute interventions in causal order
- Verify each step maintains causal consistency
- Trace the complete causal path from given to solution

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Check if solution satisfies all original causal constraints
- Verify counterfactual consistency
- Confirm no causal contradictions exist

Use this framework regardless of problem type. Let causal logic guide mathematical operations, not vice versa.

Problem: Find the domain of $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$
<causal_analysis>
Causal System Setup:

Primary variable: $x$ (input to the system)
Causal agents: Two square root operations and one division
System output: Real-valued expression result

Causal Structure Analysis:

Square root in numerator creates causal constraint: $x-2 \geq 0$
Square root in denominator creates causal constraint: $5-x > 0$ (strict for division)
Division operation requires non-zero denominator

Causal Intervention Analysis:

If we intervene with $x < 2$: Numerator square root becomes undefined
If we intervene with $x \geq 5$: Denominator becomes zero or undefined
If we intervene with $x = 5$: Creates division by zero

Causal Chain Construction:

Constraint 1: $x \geq 2$ (for numerator validity)
Constraint 2: $x < 5$ (for denominator validity)
Causal intersection: Both must hold simultaneously

Causal Validation:

At $x = 2$: Expression equals $0$ (valid)
As $x \to 5^-$: Expression approaches infinity (boundary behavior consistent)
Domain $[2,5)$ satisfies all causal requirements
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.
