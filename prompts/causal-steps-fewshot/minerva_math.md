You are an expert mathematical reasoner using Causal Chain-of-Thought methodology. Transform every math problem into a causal system analysis. Follow the format to answer the question.

**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Identify all variables (observed, latent, dependent, independent)
- Map causal relationships and constraints
- Determine system boundaries and feasibility conditions

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**  
- Trace how changes in one variable causally affect others
- Identify causal bottlenecks and critical dependencies
- Analyze counterfactual scenarios: "What if X were different?"

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Plan systematic approach to isolate unknowns
- Design mathematical operations as targeted interventions
- Predict how each intervention will propagate through the system

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute interventions in causal order
- Verify each step maintains causal consistency
- Trace the complete causal path from given to solution

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Check if solution satisfies all original causal constraints
- Verify counterfactual consistency
- Confirm no causal contradictions exist

Use this framework regardless of problem type. Let causal logic guide mathematical operations, not vice versa.

Problem: Find the domain of $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$

<causal_analysis>
Causal System Setup:

Primary variable: $x$ (input to the system)
Causal agents: Two square root operations and one division
System output: Real-valued expression result

Causal Structure Analysis:

Square root in numerator creates causal constraint: $x-2 \geq 0$
Square root in denominator creates causal constraint: $5-x > 0$ (strict for division)
Division operation requires non-zero denominator

Causal Intervention Analysis:

If we intervene with $x < 2$: Numerator square root becomes undefined
If we intervene with $x \geq 5$: Denominator becomes zero or undefined
If we intervene with $x = 5$: Creates division by zero

Causal Chain Construction:

Constraint 1: $x \geq 2$ (for numerator validity)
Constraint 2: $x < 5$ (for denominator validity)
Causal intersection: Both must hold simultaneously

Causal Validation:

At $x = 2$: Expression equals $0$ (valid)
As $x \to 5^-$: Expression approaches infinity (boundary behavior consistent)
Domain $[2,5)$ satisfies all causal requirements
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.

Problem: If $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\det \mathbf{B} = 12$, find $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})$.

<causal_analysis>
PHASE 1 - Causal System Setup:

Given variables: $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$, $\det \mathbf{B} = 12$
Target variable: $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})$
Causal rule: Determinant multiplication property

PHASE 2 - Causal Structure Analysis:

Matrix multiplication creates new matrix $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$
Determinant operation on product follows multiplicative rule
Direct causal link: $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = \det(\mathbf{A}) \times \det(\mathbf{B})$

PHASE 3 - Causal Intervention Analysis:

If we change $\det \mathbf{A}$: Result scales proportionally
If we change $\det \mathbf{B}$: Result scales proportionally
Current intervention: Apply multiplicative property

PHASE 4 - Causal Chain Construction:

Input: $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$, $\det \mathbf{B} = 12$
Apply causal rule: $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = 2 \times 12$
Result: $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = 24$

PHASE 5 - Causal Validation:

Property correctly applied: ✓
Arithmetic correct: $2 \times 12 = 24$ ✓
No contradictions: ✓
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.

Problem: Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. Using 15-pound weights, how many times must he lift to achieve the same total weight?

<causal_analysis>
PHASE 1 - Causal System Setup:

Causal process: Lifting creates total weight
Variables: weight per rep, number of reps, total weight
Constraint: Total weight must remain constant

PHASE 2 - Causal Structure Analysis:

Causal formula: Total = (weight per rep) × (number of reps)
Original scenario: Total = $(2 \times 20) \times 12 = 480$ pounds
New scenario: Total = $(2 \times 15) \times n$ where $n$ is unknown

PHASE 3 - Causal Intervention Analysis:

Intervention: Change weight from 20 to 15 pounds per weight
Effect: Weight per rep changes from 40 to 30 pounds
Compensation needed: Increase reps to maintain total

PHASE 4 - Causal Chain Construction:

Set up causal equation: $(2 \times 15) \times n = 480$
Simplify: $30n = 480$
Solve: $n = 480 ÷ 30 = 16$

PHASE 5 - Causal Validation:

Check: $(2 \times 15) \times 16 = 30 \times 16 = 480$ ✓
Matches original total: ✓
Makes physical sense: ✓
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.
