Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: Initial trees (15, observed), planted trees (unknown, latent), final trees (21, observed)
- Causal relationships: Initial + Planted → Final
- System boundaries: Grove environment, single planting event
- Feasibility: Planted trees must be non-negative integer

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- Planted trees causally determines the change from initial to final state
- Critical dependency: Final count depends on both initial count and planting action
- Counterfactual: If no trees were planted, final count would equal initial count (15)

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention: Isolate planted trees by examining the causal difference
- Operation: Subtract initial from final to isolate planting effect
- Prediction: This will reveal the causal impact of the planting action

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute: 21 - 15 = 6
- Verification: 15 + 6 = 21
- Causal path: Initial state (15) + Planting action (6) → Final state (21)

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: 6 ≥ 0 (feasible planting amount)
- Counterfactual consistency: If 6 trees weren't planted, final would be 15
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $6$. I hope it is correct.

Question: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: Initial cars (3, observed), arriving cars (2, observed), final cars (unknown, dependent)
- Causal relationships: Initial + Arriving → Final
- System boundaries: Single parking lot, one arrival event
- Feasibility: Final count must be positive integer

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- Arriving cars causally increases the total count
- Critical dependency: Final count depends on both initial presence and arrival event
- Counterfactual: If no cars arrived, final count would remain 3

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention: Combine initial state with arrival effect
- Operation: Add arriving cars to initial count
- Prediction: This will capture the causal impact of the arrival event

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute: 3 + 2 = 5
- Verification: Initial (3) + Change (+2) = Final (5)
- Causal path: Initial state (3) + Arrival event (2) → Final state (5)

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: 5 > 0 (feasible car count)
- Counterfactual consistency: If 2 cars didn't arrive, final would be 3
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $5$. I hope it is correct.

Question: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: Leah's chocolates (32, observed), sister's chocolates (42, observed), eaten chocolates (35, observed), remaining chocolates (unknown, dependent)
- Causal relationships: (Leah's + Sister's) - Eaten → Remaining
- System boundaries: Combined chocolate supply, single eating event
- Feasibility: Remaining must be non-negative

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- Initial combination creates total supply; eating event causally reduces it
- Critical dependency: Remaining depends on both initial total and consumption
- Counterfactual: If they ate 0 chocolates, remaining would equal initial total (74)

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention 1: Combine individual supplies to get total supply
- Intervention 2: Subtract eaten amount to isolate remaining
- Prediction: This captures both aggregation and consumption effects

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute intervention 1: 32 + 42 = 74 (total supply)
- Execute intervention 2: 74 - 35 = 39 (remaining)
- Verification: Initial total (74) - Consumed (35) = Remaining (39)
- Causal path: Individual supplies → Combined supply (74) → Eating event → Remaining (39)

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: 39 ≥ 0 (feasible remaining amount)
- Counterfactual consistency: If they ate 0, remaining would be 74
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $39$. I hope it is correct.

Question: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?

<causal_analysis>
**PHASE 1: CAUSAL SYSTEM SETUP**
- Variables: Jason's initial lollipops (20, observed), given lollipops (unknown, latent), Jason's final lollipops (12, observed)
- Causal relationships: Initial - Given → Final
- System boundaries: Jason's lollipop supply, single giving event
- Feasibility: Given amount must be non-negative and ≤ initial amount

**PHASE 2: CAUSAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
- Giving action causally reduces Jason's lollipop count
- Critical dependency: Final count depends on both initial count and giving action
- Counterfactual: If Jason gave 0 lollipops, his final count would be 20

**PHASE 3: CAUSAL INTERVENTION DESIGN**
- Intervention: Isolate giving effect by examining causal difference
- Operation: Subtract final from initial to reveal giving impact
- Prediction: This will quantify the causal effect of the giving action

**PHASE 4: CAUSAL CHAIN EXECUTION**
- Execute: 20 - 12 = 8
- Verification: 20 - 8 = 12
- Causal path: Initial state (20) → Giving action (-8) → Final state (12)

**PHASE 5: CAUSAL VALIDATION**
- Constraint check: 0 ≤ 8 ≤ 20 (feasible giving amount)
- Counterfactual consistency: If Jason gave 0 lollipops, he'd have 20
- No contradictions: All causal relationships satisfied
</causal_analysis>

Final Answer: The final answer is $8$. I hope it is correct.
