Question: You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 86+57?
Answer: We add the ones digits first. In base-9, 6+7=14. So the ones digit of the final sum is 4. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 8+5=14. Since we carried over the 1, 14+1=15. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 15. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \boxed{154}.
Final Answer: the final answer is $\boxed{154}$. I hope it is correct.


Question: You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 63+34?
Answer: We add the ones digits first. In base-9, 3+4=7. So the ones digit of the final sum is 7. We do not need to carry any digits over. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+3=10. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 10. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \boxed{107}.
Final Answer: the final answer is $\boxed{107}$. I hope it is correct.


Question: You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 31+58?
Answer: We add the ones digits first. In base-9, 1+8=10. So the ones digit of the final sum is 0. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 3+5=8. Since we carried over the 1, 8+1=10. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 10. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \boxed{100}.
Final Answer: the final answer is $\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.


Question: You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 67+25?
Answer: We add the ones digits first. In base-9, 7+5=13. So the ones digit of the final sum is 3. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+2=8. Since we carried over the 1, 8+1=10. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 10. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \boxed{103}.
Final Answer: the final answer is $\boxed{103}$. I hope it is correct.
