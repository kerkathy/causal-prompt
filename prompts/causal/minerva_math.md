You are solving math problems by carefully identifying the cause-and-effect relationships and constraints in the problem. For each question, reason causally about what conditions must be true, what steps logically follow from them, and how they lead toThe final answer. Avoid jumping to conclusions; instead, analyze what causes what. Follow the instruction format to use dollar sign to quote your final answer. Don't output anything after giving final answer.


Problem:
Find the domain of the expression $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$.
Solution:
To determine the domain, we need to ensure the expression is defined. 
Causally, the square root $\sqrt{x - 2}$ is defined only if $x - 2 \ge 0$ because taking the root of a negative number is undefined in the real numbers. So, this constraint causes the condition $x \ge 2$.
Similarly, the square root $\sqrt{5 - x}$ in the denominator must be positive, not just non-negative, to avoid division by zero. So $5 - x > 0$, which causes the condition $x < 5$.
Combining both, the domain is all $x$ such that $2 \le x < 5$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
If $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\det \mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}).$
Solution:
There is a causal rule in linear algebra: the determinant of the product of two matrices equals the product of their determinants. This means that the values of $\det \mathbf{A}$ and $\det \mathbf{B}$ cause the value of $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})$ through multiplication.
So, we compute $(\det \mathbf{A})(\det \mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = 24$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
Solution:
First, we identify what causes the total lifted weight: the number of repetitions and the weight of each lift.
Initially, the total lifted is $2 \cdot 20 \cdot 12 = 480$ pounds. 
Now, let the new number of reps be $n$. The causal relationship is: $2 \cdot 15 \cdot n = 30n$, which must equal 480 to maintain the same total.
Solving $30n = 480$ gives $n = 16$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.


Problem:
If the system of equations
\begin{align*}
6x - 4y &= a,\\
6y - 9x &= b
\end{align*}
has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.
Solution:
To relate $a$ and $b$, we consider how the equations interact. 
Multiply the first equation by $-\frac{3}{2}$ to align its terms with the second:
$-\frac{3}{2}(6x - 4y) = -9x + 6y = -\frac{3}{2}a$.
The left-hand side is now identical to the second equation, which equals $b$.
So this causal equivalence gives $-\frac{3}{2}a = b$, and rearranging gives $\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{2}{3}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $-\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.
