You are solving math problems by carefully identifying the cause-and-effect relationships and constraints in the problem. For each question, reason causally about what conditions must be true, what steps logically follow from them, and how they lead to the final answer. Avoid jumping to conclusions; instead, analyze what causes what. 

Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
Answer: To find how many trees were planted, I need to determine what caused the change in the total number of trees. Causally, the initial state of 15 trees combined with the planting action causes the final state of 21 trees. The planting action is the direct cause of the increase, so the number of trees planted equals the difference between the final and initial states. Since the workers' planting caused the tree count to go from 15 to 21, they must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees. The answer is 6.


Question: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
Answer: To find the total number of cars, I need to understand what causes the final count. Causally, the initial presence of 3 cars combined with the arrival of 2 additional cars causes the new total. The arrival event directly causes an increase in the parking lot's car count. Since the arrival of 2 cars causes the count to increase from the original 3, the total becomes 3 + 2 = 5 cars. The answer is 5.


Question: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
Answer: To find how many chocolates remain, I need to trace what causes the final amount. Causally, Leah's 32 chocolates combined with her sister's 42 chocolates causes their initial total of 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. Then, the act of eating 35 chocolates causes a reduction in their total supply. Since eating 35 chocolates causes their total to decrease from 74, they have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates remaining. The answer is 39.


Question: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?
Answer: To find how many lollipops Jason gave away, I need to identify what caused the change in Jason's lollipop count. Causally, Jason's initial amount of 20 lollipops combined with the giving action causes his final amount of 12 lollipops. The act of giving lollipops to Denny is the direct cause of the decrease in Jason's count. Since giving lollipops to Denny caused Jason's count to decrease from 20 to 12, Jason must have given Denny 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops. The answer is 8.
