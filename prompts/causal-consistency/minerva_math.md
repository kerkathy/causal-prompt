Problem:
Find the domain of the expression $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$.
Solution:
**STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- Goal: Find all values of x where this expression is defined
- Governing rules: Square roots require non-negative arguments; denominators cannot be zero
- Key relationship: The domain is caused by the intersection of constraints from both the numerator and denominator

**STEP 2: ESTABLISH CONSTRAINTS AND CONDITIONS**
- Constraint 1: $\sqrt{x-2}$ requires $x-2 \geq 0$ because square roots of negative numbers are undefined in real numbers
- Constraint 2: $\sqrt{5-x}$ in denominator requires $5-x > 0$ (strictly positive, not just non-negative) because division by zero is undefined
- These constraints exist because of fundamental properties of square roots and division

**STEP 3: TRACE THE CAUSAL LOGIC**
- Because $\sqrt{x-2}$ must be real, this causes the requirement $x-2 \geq 0$, which gives us $x \geq 2$
- Because $\sqrt{5-x}$ is in the denominator, this causes the requirement $5-x > 0$, which gives us $x < 5$
- Because both conditions must hold simultaneously, this causes the domain to be their intersection: $2 \leq x < 5$

**STEP 4: VERIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- At $x = 2$: $\sqrt{2-2} = 0$ (defined) and $\sqrt{5-2} = \sqrt{3} > 0$ (defined and non-zero) ✓
- At $x = 5$: $\sqrt{5-5} = 0$ would make denominator zero ✗
- The chain is logically sound

Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.

Problem:
If $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\det \mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}).$

Solution:
**STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- Goal: Find the determinant of the product $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$
- Governing rule: Determinant multiplicativity property
- Key relationship: Individual determinants cause the product's determinant through multiplication

**STEP 2: ESTABLISH CONSTRAINTS AND CONDITIONS**
- The matrices must be square and compatible for multiplication
- The determinant multiplicativity property must apply: $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = \det(\mathbf{A}) \cdot \det(\mathbf{B})$
- This property exists because determinants measure how linear transformations scale volumes

**STEP 3: TRACE THE CAUSAL LOGIC**
- Because $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$, transformation $\mathbf{A}$ scales volumes by factor 2
- Because $\det \mathbf{B} = 12$, transformation $\mathbf{B}$ scales volumes by factor 12
- Because transformations compose multiplicatively, the combined transformation $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$ causes volume scaling by $2 \times 12 = 24$
- Therefore, $\det(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = 24$

**STEP 4: VERIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- The multiplicativity property is a fundamental theorem in linear algebra ✓
- Our calculation follows directly from this property ✓
- The result is consistent with the geometric interpretation ✓

Final Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.

Problem:
Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?

Solution:
**STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- Goal: Find number of repetitions needed with lighter weights
- Governing relationship: Total weight = (weight per rep) × (number of reps)
- Key causality: Decreasing weight per rep requires increasing reps to maintain same total

**STEP 2: ESTABLISH CONSTRAINTS AND CONDITIONS**
- Total weight must remain constant between scenarios
- Weight per rep = 2 × (weight of each individual weight)
- Number of reps must be a positive integer (you can't do fractional reps)

**STEP 3: TRACE THE CAUSAL LOGIC**
- Because Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, this causes total weight = $2 \times 20 \times 12 = 480$ pounds
- Because he switches to two 15-pound weights, this causes new weight per rep = $2 \times 15 = 30$ pounds
- Because total weight must remain 480 pounds, this causes the equation: $30 \times n = 480$ where $n$ is the new number of reps
- Because $30n = 480$, this causes $n = 480 ÷ 30 = 16$

**STEP 4: VERIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- Check: $2 \times 15 \times 16 = 30 \times 16 = 480$ pounds
- This matches the original total weight
- 16 is a positive integer (realistic for reps)

Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.

Problem:
If the system of equations
\begin{align*}
6x - 4y &= a,\\
6y - 9x &= b
\end{align*}
has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.

Solution:
**STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- Goal: Find the ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ when the system has nonzero solutions
- Governing principle: For nonzero solutions to exist, the equations must be dependent (not independent)
- Key insight: Dependency causes a fixed relationship between $a$ and $b$

**STEP 2: ESTABLISH CONSTRAINTS AND CONDITIONS**
- For nonzero solutions to exist, the coefficient matrix must be singular (determinant = 0)
- This creates a dependency between the equations, which constrains the relationship between $a$ and $b$
- The system must be consistent for solutions to exist

**STEP 3: TRACE THE CAUSAL LOGIC**
- Because we need nonzero solutions, the equations must be proportional (dependent)
- Because we want to relate the equations, multiply the first equation by a constant to match terms in the second
- Multiply first equation by $-\frac{3}{2}$: $-\frac{3}{2}(6x - 4y) = -9x + 6y$
- Because this gives us $-9x + 6y = -\frac{3}{2}a$
- Because the second equation is $-9x + 6y = b$
- Because both expressions equal $-9x + 6y$, this causes $b = -\frac{3}{2}a$
- Because $b = -\frac{3}{2}a$, this causes $\frac{a}{b} = -\frac{2}{3}$

**STEP 4: VERIFY THE CAUSAL CHAIN**
- The coefficient matrix determinant: $(6)(6) - (-4)(-9) = 36 - 36 = 0$ (confirms dependency)
- Our proportionality relationship is mathematically sound
- The ratio is well-defined since $b \neq 0$ by assumption

Final Answer: The final answer is $-\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.
